Codepinion is a platform that provides to Programmers :

- A place where they can **Store** any project's source code and retreave it from any device that has access to the internet.
- A place where they can **edit** and **run** their code without having to download it to do that locally.
- Eventually, an **AI Assitant** will be fitted to make the programmers work even easier.
